1.6 -- HellaWorld

* Name of project changed to HellaWorld due to similarity with HellaHella.

* Changed the way stylesheets are handled by non Javascript enabled clients
  to reduce the number of styles that need to be set at runtime by javascript
  enabled browsers

* Fixed a couple of minor CSS bugs in Internet Explorer

* Fixed a bug where NZB names weren't having special characters converted to
  html entities

* Fixed a bug in the error handling page. The error page no longer attempts to
  display HellaNZB status information when an error has occured, as under such
  conditions displaying the information is most likely impossible.

* Tidied up the javascript ever so slightly

* added HellaController::setRarPass() to HellaController

* Added the ability to specify a rar password for an NZB file from the queue.

* Fixed an uninitialized value bug in the authentication system caused by a
  typo

* Fixed a bug where adding a url instead of a newzbin id would have no effect

* Made sorting of the queue by name case insensitive

* Made the way HellaController::getStatus() handles the log entries more
  efficient

* Fixed a bug in HellaController::enqueue() where it was incorrectly
  parsing the input

* Tidied up HellaController:enqueueNewzbin() to clarify it

* Changed the input validation used by HellaController:enqueueURL() to
  make it less strict, and able to handle local URLs

* Changed the JSON template to use the PHP JSON extension.

* Fixed HellaController:listNZBs() so that it actually returns the list
  generated.

* Added handling to HellaController:getStatus() so that no E_NOTICEs are
  generated if HellaNZB doesn't return the size of a queue item

* Fixed a bug where the path wasn't being determined properly if
  HellaWorld was installed in a directory accessed via mod_alias

1.5
* Fixed a potential issue with the XML-RPC client, XML-RPC requests will now
  timeout before the maximum execution time is reached

* Added additional styles to the queue items so that they change colour on
  mouseover

* Fixed a bug where the option to refresh every 15 seconds was hidden if
  no items were in the queue

* Changed the re-order system from a select to a text box to reduce total
  HTML output, this will speed up large queues significantly. It should also
  help overcome a reoccuring bug in manual queue sorting where moving lots of
  queue items in one direction could lead to them being jumbled up.

* Moved from the bloated and slow script.aculo.us javascript framework to one
  called jquery. This has sped up performance of the javascript for large
  queues enormously.

* Made AJAX refreshing of the details more efficient, using a single AJAX
  request and returning JSON.

* Reduced the number of XML-RPC requests required when moving a queue item via
  drag and drop. Now it will only send requests for the queue item that moved
  instead of it's previous behaviour of issueing move commands for every item,
  regardless of whether it has moved or not.

* Due to a bug in the new Javascript framework, drag and drop sorting has been
  limited to a draggable handle on each queue item. This will be changed back
  as soon as the bug in the framework is fixed. The bug prevents form elements
  within draggables from baining focus, making it impossible to edit their
  contents

* Added extra information from HellaNZB such as the uptime, HellaNZB version
  and total downloaded files, segments and NZB files.

* Added the current HelloHella version to the page title and README for
  clarity.

1.4
* Tidied up the HTML / Javascript

* Moved parts of the template into their own files

* Added a feature that saves the status of the log file, once shown the status
  will be saved in a cookie and be kept shown until it is again hidden

* Added an automatic refresh feature, when ticked the information will
  automatically refresh every 15 seconds

* Fixed a bug whereby sorting largue queues by a custom order could result in
  a jumbled order.

1.3
* Fixed a bug in the javascript controls where the queue ETA wouldn't update
  after dragging an item to the new position in the queue.

* Fixed a bug where the currently processing NZB wasn't being displayed.

* Fixed a bug in the progress bar where a download at 100% wouldn't show a
  full bar.

* Fixed a fatal bug in the input processing for enqueueing of NZB files via
  URL or Newzbin Article ID.

* Cleaned up some of the files, made the config file a
  sample file by default.

1.2
* Fixed a bug where users entering an incorrect password at runtime would be
  unable to have a second chance without closing and reopening their browser

* Added javascript controls to queue items, allowing them to be sorted via
  drag and drop on top of the existing queue controls

1.1
* Fixed a minor Javascript bug with an empty Queue

* Added support for requesting the password at runtime

* Fixed a stylesheet bug making buttons hard to click

* Fixed a queue ETA bug
