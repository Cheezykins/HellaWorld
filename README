**Note - this is a defunct project and is purely here for historical reasons. The code is old, it's not great and I wouldn't use it in production (I'm not even sure if HellaNZB is still maintained). This is what I could import from the old SVN repository using svn2git.

HellaWorld v1.10-SVN
---------------------

*General Intall*

The installation is as simple as these 5 steps:

1) Copy config-sample.php to config.php
2) Open config.php in your favorite text editor
3) Edit the settings as you wish
4) Save and close your text editor
5) Upload the files to your webserver and view in your browser of choice

For more detailed configuration information, please read on.

*Authentication*

HellaWorld supports 4 authentication modes.

Open: Open to everyone without a password (Default)
Closed: Login required every time you visit
Hybrid: Open for specified IP ranges (defaults to the 3 standard private
        address ranges) login is required for all others
Exclusive: Closed for all addresses except those in the specified IP
           range

*Supported Languages*

Multiple languages are supported using GNU Gettext. Language codes are
in the form of lang_COUNTRY, so en_GB for English or sv_SE for Swedish.

Language codes with translations available are:
en_GB - English (Default)
en_US - American English
nl_NL - Dutch
sv_SE - Swedish

If you would like to translate HellaWorld into your native language,
please read the GNU Gettext documentation, the standard English messages
are located in locale/en_GB.UTF-8/messages.po

*Tracking Finished Items*

Tracking finished items will show a list of items completed by HellaNZB
but requires that both HellaNZB and HellaWorld be running on the same
machine, and does not work on Windows.

To track finished items you will have to edit your HellaNZB config to
include a Hellanzb.EXTERNAL_HANDLER_SCRIPT directive, like so:

Hellanzb.EXTERNAL_HANDLER_SCRIPT = '/path/to/hellaworld/completed.php'

For this to work, hellaworld/completed.xml must be writable by both the
user that HellaNZB is running as, and the user that HellaWorld is running
as. The latter is usually the same user that the web server is running as.

Displaying the finished items can be turned on or off in your config.php,
see the updates to config-sample.php to see what to add to existing
configurations.
