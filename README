HellaWorld v1.8-SVN
---------------------

*General Use*

General usage is pretty simple, copy config-sample.php to config.php
then change the settings to match your HellaNZB install.
Then upload and view the site within your web browser. That should
be all that's necessary.

*Supported Languages*

Multiple languages are supported using GNU Gettext. Language codes are
in the form of lang_COUNTRY, so en_GB for English or sv_SE for Swedish.

Language codes with translations available are:
en_GB - English (Default)
en_US - American English
nl_NL - Dutch
sv_SE - Swedish

If you would like to translate HellaWorld into your native language,
please read the GNU Gettext documentation, the standard English messages
are located in locale/en_GB.UTF-8/messages.po

*Tracking Finished Items*

Tracking finished items will show a list of items completed by HellaNZB
but requires that both HellaNZB and HellaWorld be running on the same
machine, and does not work on Windows.

To track finished items you will have to edit your HellaNZB config to
include a Hellanzb.EXTERNAL_HANDLER_SCRIPT directive, like so:

Hellanzb.EXTERNAL_HANDLER_SCRIPT = '/path/to/hellaworld/completed.php'

For this to work, hellaworld/completed.xml must be writable by both the
user that HellaNZB is running as, and the user that HellaWorld is running
as. The latter is usually the same user that the web server is running as.

Displaying the finished items can be turned on or off in your config.php,
see the updates to config-sample.php to see what to add to existing
configurations.
