I've started work on an experimental new feature which I've imaginatively named autonzb.

It's designed to look at the RSS feeds generated by newzbin's saved searches and automatically add
new episodes to the queue as they come along.

You'll need to do a few things to make it work.

 * Set cron.php to run every x hours.
 * Make sure feeds.xml is writable by the user the cron job runs as.
 * Use the new bookmarklet to add feeds to the list. You can see the ones you currently
   have under the new tab, 'NZB Feeds'. When you add one, it takes note of the latest episode
   number, and only queues one up when the number increases.

There's a lot left to do:
 * Web management (adding, deleting) of feeds.
 * Documentation.
 * Translation.
 * General code tidying.

But, give this a go, and let me know what you think.
